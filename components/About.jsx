        CBIT Open Source Community, an esteemed tech community based in
        Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology - Hyderabad, is dedicated to
        promoting an open-source ethos. We organize a diverse range of events
        such as hackathons, bootcamps, and workshops, aimed at educating
        students about various technologies while actively fostering a culture
        of open source. In these dynamic gatherings, students immerse themselves
        in collaborative coding sessions, innovative problem-solving challenges,
        and hands-on experiences, all centered around open source principles. By
        embracing this approach, we empower students to not only learn about
        cutting-edge technologies but also actively contribute to their
        development and dissemination.

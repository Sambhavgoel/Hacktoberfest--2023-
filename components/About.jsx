      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>CBIT Open Source Community, n esteemed tech community based in Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology - Hyderabad, is dedicated to promoting an open-source ethos.
        We organize a diverse range of events such as hackathons, bootcamps, and workshops, aimed at educating students about various technologies while actively fostering a culture of open source.
        In these dynamic gatherings, students immerse themselves in collaborative coding sessions, innovative problem-solving challenges, and hands-on experiences, all centered around open source principles.
        By embracing this approach, we empower students to not only learn about cutting-edge technologies but also actively contribute to their development and dissemination.</p>
